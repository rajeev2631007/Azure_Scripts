Explanation:

    Variables:
        $targetIP: Stores the IP address to ping.
        $logFile: Path to the file where results will be logged.
        $iterationCount: Keeps track of the number of iterations.
    Loop:
        A while loop continues as long as $iterationCount is less than 500.
    Ping Test:
        Test-Connection cmdlet is used with -ComputerName and -Count 1 parameters to ping the target IP address once.
        -Quiet parameter suppresses additional information, leaving only success/failure indication.
    Logging Results:
        The output ($pingResult) is appended to the $logFile along with a timestamp using Write-Host >> $logFile.
    Iteration Control:
        $iterationCount is incremented after each loop.
    Sleep:
        Start-Sleep pauses the script for 1 second before the next iteration.
    Script Completion:
        After the loop finishes, a message indicating script completion is displayed.

Saving the Script:

    Copy the script content.
    Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad).
    Paste the script content.
    Save the file with a .ps1 extension (e.g., ping_check.ps1).

Running the Script:

    Open a PowerShell window (Run as administrator if needed).

    Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

    Execute the script using the following command:

.\ping_check.ps1

This script will continuously ping the target IP, log the results to the specified file, and automatically stop after 500 iterations.
